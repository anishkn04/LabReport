**About this project**

This Project was created as a college submission project.
Since this is my first web project (_Almost First_) there are a lot of caveats, but since this will be useful in my daily activities, I do not intend to stop working on this project.

**What's working?**
1. Creating Reports (Implementation of JS for various useful features)
2. Viewing Report (Unlike what the name says, it can be updated and will be in the same format as a form)
3. Deleting Reports
4. Login/Logout (This will  be used to create and view report, the reports are shared between accounts for now)

**Plans for improvement?**
1. Viewing and updating reports will be separate things, i.e updating will be the same as it is now but viewing will be formatted in printable way.
2. Accounts will be further improved so that the admin can change Contact info, Title, and a lot more.
3. The create report section will be modified to use database instead of plain text, thus admins will be able to add and remove tests as per their needs.
4. The website will be more responsive and styled for mobile users after adding major features.
5. That's what I can remember for now. Any new ideas will be added to this section.

**Currently working on?**

_The project has been put on hold temporarily due to my exams._
